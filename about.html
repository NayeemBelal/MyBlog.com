    <div class="about-content"><div align="center"><p>Hi, My name is <b>Nayeem Belal</b>. I am an aspiring <i>web developer</i> at idesignify and started my trainin on july 3. I plan to stay here until college where I will pursue my dreams of becoming a heart surgeon. My family wants me to go into the medical feild because it is very stable and gives good pay. I also want to go into the Medical feild because I cant ever see myself sitting in front of a computer all day everyday. And the medical feild is really hands on with everything so thats the best thing about.</p>
    <p>I love this training place because it allows me to get creative with my work and actually think about what I get to do next. The possibilities are endless here a idesignify! I love to eat anything, even vegeitables because my mom and dad raised me properly. Eating makes me happy and even though I eat alot, i am still pretty skinny becuase of my abnormaly high metabolism. I am aspiring to become a garbage truck driver and take out the trash that people create. I like it because of the beutifull smell and the level at which people treat you when you are a garbage truck driver.</p></div>
