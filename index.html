    <div class="post-content"><div align="center"><p>If somebody woud have told me a week ago that i would be able to make website, i would not have believed them</p>
        <p>Just a few days later, I came across <b><a href="https://getmimo.com/ ">MIMO</a></b> and started to work on a real blog while eating noodles. i also love to eat ice cream. One of my favorite hobbies is to read because it give the mind a chance to becoe creative and imagine things that can never exist in the real world. Reading also stimulates my mind and makes me think about anything society has to throw at me. My parents and extended family also likes to read so its not that big of a suprisetht I like to read. Basketball is also something I live for because BALL IS LIFE.</p></div></div>
